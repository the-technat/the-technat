I'm Nathanael, technat or the-technat.
Kubernetes engineer, minimalist, perfectionist, optimist and enthusiast for everything that looks like a container. I've got zero background in classic IT and was born into the cloud-native world (does this explain my optimistic approach sometimes ðŸ˜‰?)

## Contact

You can reach me:
- on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.slack.com) or [CNCF](https://cloud-native.slack.com) slack
- via mail [technat@technat.ch](mailto:technat@technat.ch)

## GPG Key

I got my own GPG key, if you need to send me something super secure.

You can find it on most keyservers when searching for my mail, or just get it [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/DC199950E4517F14CBB68A8D22391B207DAD6969).

Valid until Nov 05, 2027
