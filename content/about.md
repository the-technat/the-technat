I'm Nathanael, technat or the-technat.
Kubernetes engineer, minimalist, perfectionist, optimist and enthusiast for everything that looks like a container. I've got zero background in classic IT and was born into the cloud-native world (does this explain my optimistic approach sometimes ðŸ˜‰?)

## Contact

You can reach me:
- on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.slack.com) or [CNCF](https://cloud-native.slack.com) slack
- via mail [technat@technat.ch](mailto:technat@technat.ch)
