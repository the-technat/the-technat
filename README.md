### Nathanael Liechti

Hi I'm technat. system engineer for Kubernetes, minimalist, perfectionist and optimist. I've got zero background in classic IT and was born into the cloud-native world (does this explain my optimistic approach sometimes 😉?)

- 🔭 I’m currently getting familiar with Terraform providers, specifically [terraform-provider-argocd](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/terraform-provider-argocd)
- 🌱 I’m always learning many things in parallel
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Terraform Modules, Go applications and other K8s / CNCF projects
- 💬 Ask me about Go, Terraform, CI/CD and **Kubernetes** or take a look at my [Website](https://technat.ch)
- 📫 You can reach me on [CNCF Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com) or by [Mail](mailto:technat@technat.ch)
- ⚡ Fun fact: Seems like someone has already taken the username "technat", so it was necessary to mention that technat isn´t the same as **the**-technat
