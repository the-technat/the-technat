### the-technat

Hi I'm technat. Kubernetes Engineer, minimalist and perfectionist, loving to explore the world of IT more and more.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on writing a concept for my own homelab  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning too many things to list here..
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Go, Terraform, CI/CD and **Kubernetes**
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at technat@technat.ch
- âš¡ Fun fact: Seems like someone has already taken the username "technat", so it was necessary to mention that technat isnÂ´t the same as **the**-technat ;)

Sometimes I document my learnings and work in my [wiki](https://wiki.technat.ch). Feel free to see if anything might be helpful for you.

Searching my [GPG key](https://gpg.technat.ch)?
