### Nathanael Liechti

Hi I'm technat. Kubernetes Engineer, minimalist, perfectionist and enthusiast for everything that looks like a container.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on writing a concept for my own homelab and engineering Azure AKS
- 🌱 I’m always learning many things in parallel, I can't list them all...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Terraform Modules, Go applications and other K8s / CNCF projects around Kubernetes
- 💬 Ask me about Go, Terraform, CI/CD and **Kubernetes** or take a look at my [Wiki](https://wiki.technat.ch)
- 📫 You can reach me at technat@technat.ch (in case you need it: [GPG key](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/DC199950E4517F14CBB68A8D22391B207DAD6969))
- ⚡ Fun fact: Seems like someone has already taken the username "technat", so it was necessary to mention that technat isn´t the same as **the**-technat ;)

Merged @liechtinat into this account, to only maintain one GH account.
