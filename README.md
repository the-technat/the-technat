Hi I'm technat. Kubernetes Engineer, minimalist, perfectionist and enthusiast for everything that looks like a container.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an IoT project called [weddingphone](https://github.com/the-technat/weddingphone).
  - Oh and of fcourse as a Kubernetes Engineer I also have my private K8s cluster ;)
- 🌱 I’m always learning many things in parallel, I can't list them all here...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Terraform Modules, Go applications and other K8s / CNCF projects around Kubernetes
- 💬 Ask me about Go, Terraform, CI/CD and **Kubernetes** or take a look at my [Website](https://technat.ch)
- 📫 You can reach me at technat@technat.ch (in case you need it: [GPG key](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/DC199950E4517F14CBB68A8D22391B207DAD6969))
- ⚡ Fun fact: Seems like someone has already taken the username "technat", so it was necessary to mention that technat isn´t the same as **the**-technat ;)
